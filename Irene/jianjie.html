				The story begins when Harry Potter is sent as an orphan to live with his aunt, where he suffers neglect and abuse for ten years. However, when Harry was eleven years old, his life changed dramatically. Harry learns that he is a wizard and is invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
				At Hogwarts, Harry meets two of his best friends, Hermione Granger and RON Weasley, with whom he experiences many adventures and challenges. Harry also discovers that he has a mysterious lightning-shaped scar left on his body by the evil dark wizard Lord Voldemort when he was a baby. Voldemort attempts to kill Harry, but his attempts fail, causing his own powers to weaken.
As Harry progresses through Hogwarts, he begins to realize that he has a close bond with Lord Voldemort and becomes a key figure in the fight against him. Throughout the series, Harry and his friends continue to uncover Voldemort's secrets in preparation for the final confrontation.
				Themes of growth, courage, friendship, and sacrifice run through the series, revealing a world full of magic and wonder. The Harry Potter series is not only loved by readers, but has also been adapted into a series of successful films and become a global cultural phenomenon.
