					The decision to choose a school for your child is never an easy one, and as a parent I know this all too well. <br>
					SJNA looks forward to working with you as your children grow and mature. <br>
					It is often said that it takes generations to raise a child successfully. <br>
					The professional skills, values, and character building that children need to be successful are deeply embedded in our school's culture and traditions.<br>
					I can appreciate the importance of finding the best school for your child, with teachers who are able to unlock a child's potential and build on his or her strengths. <br>
					As an educator, I am proud to serve as the Executive Director of Seiren SJNA. <br>
					This is the cradle of success. <br>
					Our school has four cornerstones of success:<br>
					academic excellence, physical and mental health, character building, and leadership development.
