					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							Self-reflection is as important here as learning about the subject matter, because if we don't know ourselves, how are we going to face all the challenges that life presents to us?
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							Here, everyone can make a difference too, because every student or teacher can ask serious questions to the whole school and people will listen to you.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							A place where each student can create their own learning program, where everyone is different. Each student has a Growth Coach with whom they can meet and receive support on a daily basis.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							Here, we don't advocate competition and we don't want to imitate each other, or anyone else for that matter. How are you going to discover your own talents and what you love to do if  you keep imitating others? Sometimes you have to get out of your own way.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							Here there is no fear or authority and young people are free to nurture and exercise their responsibilities.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:30px;">
							Here, there are students and teachers from all over the world. It doesn't matter what city you come from, what background you come from, none of that matters, what matters is that we are working, playing, exploring, laughing, crying, searching, and learning together here at Seiren SJNA.

						No matter what time of day it is, the doors of Seiren SJNA are always open for you!
