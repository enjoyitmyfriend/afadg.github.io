			During the war, Nazi Germany's military forces achieved some victories in the early stages, but as the war progressed, the Allies gradually gained the upper hand. Finally, in 1945, Nazi Germany was defeated and surrendered, Hitler committed suicide, and Germany was occupied by the Allies in different areas, entering a new historical period.
