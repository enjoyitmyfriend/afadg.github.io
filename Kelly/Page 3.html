	<h1 style='font-family:Bradley Hand; font-size:25pt; color:#ff0000; text-align: center;'>
		Today, Nazism is regarded as one of the darkest chapters in human history, and its signs and symbols (such as the swastika) are strictly prohibited in most countries in the world because they represent racism, hatred and atrocities, and pose a serious threat to the peace and stability of human society. Countries around the world are committed to remembering this history and preventing the restoration of Nazism in order to safeguard human peace, freedom and dignity.
	</h1>
	<h1 style='font-family:Bradley Hand; font-size:25pt; color:#ff0000; text-align:center;'>
		The existence of Nazism is a constant reminder of the dangers of extremism, racism and totalitarianism. It is an object that human society must resolutely resist and criticize to ensure that the tragedy of history does not repeat itself.
	</h1>
	<h1 style='font-family:Bradley Hand; font-size:25pt; color:#ff0000; text-align: center;'>
		It should be noted that in many countries, it is illegal to promote, advocate or display Nazi signs and slogans, because this may incite hatred, undermine social peace and stability, and is also disrespectful to the victims of the Nazis. We should learn lessons from history and work together to promote a more just, peaceful and inclusive world.
	</h1>
	<h1 style='font-family:Bradley Hand; font-size:60pt; color:#ff0000; text-align:center;'>
		Please remember that the purpose of discussing Nazism is to reflect on history, not to promote or glorify its ideas and behaviors.
