					What is Chicken Shawarma?
				</h2>
			<p>
				Chicken Shawarma is a favorite among many. It involves marinating chicken in a mixture of spices, then cooking it on a rotating spit. The cooked chicken is usually sliced and served in a pita bread with vegetables 					like tomatoes, cucumbers, and a variety of sauces such as tahini or garlic sauce.<br><br>
				Ingredients<br>
				• Chicken: 1 whole chicken (cut into quarters or halves)<br>
				• Onions: 4-5 large onions (sliced thinly)<br>
				• Sumac: 3-4 tablespoons<br>
				• Olive oil: 1/2 cup<br>
				• Flatbread: Taboon bread or thin flatbread<br>
				• Spices:<br>
				• Salt: 2 teaspoons (to taste)<br>
				• Black pepper: 1 teaspoon<br>
				• Allspice: 1 teaspoon<br>
				• Cinnamon: 1/2 teaspoon<br>
				• Pine nuts: 1/4 cup (toasted for garnish)<br>
				• Lemon juice: 2 tablespoons (optional)<br>
				<br>
				Instructions<br>
				1. Marinate the Chicken:<br>

				3. Bake the Chicken:<br>
				• Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).<br>

				4. Prepare the Bread:<br>
				• Spread the sumac-onion mixture evenly over the flatbread.<br>
				• If desired, place the bread in the oven for a few minutes to warm it.<br>
				5. Assemble the Dish:<br>
